/*{\Mdefinition
Class |\Mtype| provides an interface for controlling certain advanced features 
of double--precision arithmetic that are realized in the hardware 
of most modern PC's and workstations. 
This class cannot be instantiated and all its member functions are
static.
Note that class |\Mtype| can only be used on such machines that conform 
(at least partially) to the IEEE754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.
In the the implementation section we give a list of processor families 
for which class |\Mtype| is available.
The most important goals of class |leda_fpu| are
\begin{itemize} 
\item Rounding control
\item Exception control
\item Control of arithmetic traps and trap handling
\end{itemize}
Rounding modes, exceptions and traps are controlled in hardware 
by certain bits in the so-called {\em floating-point control register} 
(FCR). Note that this register is also occasionally called 
{\em floating-point status register} (FSR) and that for some machines
there are separate FCR and FSR registers. 

There are four rounding modes for
|double| arithmetic specified by IEEE754:
\begin{itemize}
\item |ieee_nearest|  : always round towards the nearest representable value
\item |ieee_positive| : always round up to the next bigger representable value
\item |ieee_negative| : always round down to the next smaller representable value
\item |ieee_tozero|   : chop off all bits after the least significant bit of the
                        exact result.
\end{itemize}


There are five arithmetic exceptions whose occurence is by default noted down 
in the FSR. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item |ieee_inexact|   : inexact operation (loss of precision)
\item |ieee_overflow|  : arithmetic overflow (exponent of result too large)
\item |ieee_underflow| : arithmetic underflow (exponent of result too small)
\item |ieee_invalid|   : invalid operation (e.g. $\infty-\infty$, $\sqrt{-1}$,...)
\item |ieee_divbyzero| : division by zero (e.g. $1/0$).
\end{itemize}
If one of the previous arithmetic exceptions occurs, a ''sticky bit'' in the
FCR is raised which stays raised until explicitly cleared.
A more precise description of the meaning of these exceptions can be 
found in the original paper on the IEEE754 standard \cite{IEEE754} or 
in Goldberg's survey paper \cite{Goldberg-IEEE}.

IEEE754 demands that there exists a mechanism to activate exception handlers 
via arithmetic traps. First of all we provide a function to {\em inactivate} 
all arithmetic traps. For the LEDA library this is probably the most important 
option regarding arithmetic traps. Sometimes however, in particular if one 
debugs a program suspected of having problems with arithmetic exceptions, 
it is convenient to have a message displayed as soon as an arithmetic 
exception occurs. Here it is important to (1) get informed about the precise 
type of the exception and (2) to get this information immediately (or at least 
as quick as possible). Unfortunately in real systems these wishes are not 
always satisfied, either because implementations are only partially compliant 
to IEEE754 or because the combination of operating system and compiler do not 
let the programmer use all of the floating point features of which 
the processor is capable. This means that the behaviour of the trap handling 
utilities of class |leda_fpu| is somewhat platform-dependent. Class |leda_fpu| provides 
several policies for trap handling, which are selected by the function 
|leda_fpu::set_exception_policy(exc)| for a subset |exc| of the IEEE754 exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item |leda_fpu::ignore|: inactivate the traps for the exceptions given 
      by |exc|, and always clear the associated sticky exception bits in the FSR. 
      The effect is that - using the functions of class |leda_fpu| - it is not
      possible to detect if an exception in |exc| has occured while this policy
      is active. 
\item |leda_fpu::silence|: inactivate the traps for |exc|, but keep the 
      respective sticky exception bits set for further investigation. This is 
      the default policy. 
\item |leda_fpu::immediate|: handle the exceptions |exc| directly by 
      a handler routine that is specified via |leda_fpu::set_imediate_handler|.
      If possible, use the IEEE754 trap mechanism to call the handler;
      otherwise call the handler from software routines of class |leda_fpu|,
      as soon as possible. Note that often the trap handler cannot recognize 
      the exact type of exception that has caused the trap, and that the program
      might not be able to continue after returning from the handler function. 
\item |leda_fpu::retrospective|: inactivate the traps for |exc|. At program 
      termination, call a function specified by |leda_fpu::set_retrospective_handler| 
      that usually displays a warning message for every exception that has 
      occured during the time when the |leda_fpu::retrospective| policy was active
      for this exception. 
\end{itemize}

There are various restrictions for the usage of class |\Mtype|. First of all, 
it is only implementable for machines that conform to the IEEE754 standard,
and currently is implemented for a subset of these machines. 
Moreover, there are processor lines for which there are subtle bugs in 
the hardware implementation of certain floating-point computations. 
For example, on some older DEC alpha processors, directed rounding
did not work correctly (even though appropriate compiler flags were used
to generate machine code for ``dynamic rounding''). 
In other cases, the computing environment (operating system/compiler)
makes it impossible for the trap handlers to return safely to the main
program. To cope with all these platform-dependencies, there is a
set of functions to check the behaviour on the given platform. 
This makes it possible to write platform-independent code. 

Further restrictions have to do with compiler optimization. Some 
compilers compute the values of variables which they regard as constants 
at compile-time, depending on the level of optimization.
This may defeat the FPU rounding, precision or exception control. 
One way to guard against this kind of trouble is to put all such 
computations in non-inline functions and compile these functions
in a different translation unit. When using class |\Mtype|, please check 
first the manual of your compiler to avoid optimization that is expressedly 
not IEEE conform; e.g. IBM Cset requires the option -qstrict 
at optimization level -O3.

Please inform us about any other trouble you encounter using class |\Mtype|.
Although this software was carefully tested, there may be other problems
that we are not aware of. In such cases, please contact met at 
burnikel@mpi-sb.mpg.de or the LEDA administration at ledares@mpi-sb.mpg.de .

/*{\Mimplementation
Many of the methods of class |\Mtype| cannot be implemented using standard 
C/\CC, since these high-level languages do not provide access to the 
floating-point control and status registers.
Although some compiler libraries contain procedures that provide part
of the functionality of class |\Mtype|, none of the libraries provides 
the complete functionality.
Moreover, the interfaces vary not only from machine to machine, but also
from compiler version to compiler version.
Here we decided to write class |\Mtype| from scratch, using a few lines
of GNU assembler code which has to be re-written for every processor family 
but can be used for all compilers on the same machine.
For this reason, the functions of class |\Mtype| currently can only be inlined 
when GNU compilers are used.

Our code was developed and tested for the following platforms.
Here the particular version of the operating system should not matter
and using other compilers on the supported architectures should not be 
a problem. However, beware of the restrictions mentioned in the 
definition section.
\begin{itemize}
\item SPARC/solaris with GNU(g++)
\item MIPS/irix with MipsPro(CC)
\item x86/linux with GNU(g++)
\item alpha/linux with GNU(g++)
\end{itemize}
In principle, portations of class |\Mtype| are possible for all processors 
having a FPU compliant to IEEE754.
Notable exceptions are Cray and VAX architectures, which are not IEEE754
compliant. Moreover, the DEC alpha architecture supports IEEE754 only partially
in hardware which implies several restrictions: Directed rounding and the
correct computation of overflow, underflow, and division by zero exceptions
may require the use of special compile options on these machines.
