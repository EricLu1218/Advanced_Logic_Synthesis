/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEC alpha architecture layout 
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* 
 *  Sources: 
 *  1) Alpha Architectire Handbook Version 4
 *  2) Alpha Implementations and architecture; 
 *     Complete Reference and Guide (author: Bhandarkar)
 *
 *  The ALPHA architecture does not provide full IEEE754 functionality
 *  _in hardware_ (See page 293, 10.6.6 above in Bhandarkar's book).
 *  This is because e.g. all overflows and invalid operations are trapped
 *  and underflow is handled by flushing to zero, by default.
 *  Proper results for these exceptions can only be obtained by
 *  kernel software (in case of underflow a certain qualifier has to 
 *  be set). In particular, this means that fp operations can take
 *  a few hundred times longer than normal if an exception occurs.
 *  Similarly, rounding to nearest is hard-coded into the
 *  operations by default and hence dynamic rounding according to the 
 *  rounding bits in the control word can only be achieved by
 *  setting the qulifier /D.
 *  E.g. using g++/gcc 2.8 one needs -mfp-rounding-mode=d and 
 *  for CC/cc -fprm (the latter information is from Sylvain Pion)
 *  Furthermore g++ -mieee allows to cimoute infinities, NaN's and
 *  denormalized numbers.

/* The layout for the combined control/status word: 
 * Here a part of the 64-bit FPCR (fp control register) named Fbox 
 * is relevant.
 *
 *    63       62      61     60   59-58   57    56    55    54    53    52    
 *  Summary | INED |  UNFD | UNDZ | DYN  | IOV | INE | UNF | OVF | DZE | INV |
 *
 *   51     50      49    48    47    46-0
 *  OVFD | DZED | INVD | DNZ | DNOD | res.
 *
 *  Summary: exception summary
 *
 *  DYN    : dynamic rounding mode selection
 *           Only used when machine operation has /D specifier
 *           in the instruction field (caution!)
 *
 *   00 = to zero (chop)
 *   01 = to -infinity
 *   10 = to nearest
 *   11 = to +infinity
 *
 *  The following are the sticky exception flags.
 *  (There are no trap enabling bits, but only 
 *   *optional trap disable bits*, see below )
 *
 *  IOV    : integer overflow
 *  INE    : inexact operation
 *  UNF    : underflow
 *  OVF    : overflow
 *  DZE    : division by zero
 *  INV    : invalid operation
 *
 *  There are trap disable bits whose implementation is *optional* and 
 *  which are only valid together with the /S qualifier. These are  
 *  OVFD, DZED, INVD. There are also INED and UNFD disbale bits, but 
 *  they need additional /I and /U qualifiers, respectively. 
 *
 *  To complete the mess, there are more FCR bits:
 *
 *  UNDZ Flush underflow to zero
 *  DNZ  Treat all denormal IEEE operands as zero 
 *  DNOD Has effect only if DNZ is not set. Disables the 
 *  INVD exception that would otherwise be triggered for
 *       denormal operands.
