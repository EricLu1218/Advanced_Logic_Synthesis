/*{\Mtext 


A \emph{matching} in a graph $G$ is a subset $M$ of the 
edges of $G$ such that no two share an endpoint. A node cover is a set of nodes
|NC| such that every edge has at least one endpoint in |NC|. The maximum
cardinality of a matching is at most the minimum cardinality of a node cover.
In bipartite
graph, the two quantities are equal.

/*{\Mtext
We offer several implementations of bipartite matching 
algorithms. All of them require that the bipartition $(A,B)$ is given
and that all
edges are directed from $A$ to $B$; all
of them return a maximum cardinality matching and a minimum cardinality
node cover. The initial characters of the inventors are used to distinguish
between the algorithms. The common interface is
\begin{verbatim}
   list<edge> MAX_CARD_BIPARTITE_MATCHING_XX(graph& G, 
                                             const list<node>& A, 
                                             const list<node>& B,
                                             node_array<bool>& NC,
                                             bool use_heuristic = true);
\end{verbatim}
where XX is to be replaced by either HK, ABMP, FF, or FFB. All algorithms can
be asked to use a heuristic to find an initial matching. This is the default.

HK stands for the algorithm due to Hopcroft and Karp~\cite{HK75}. It
has running time $O(\sqrt{n}m)$.

ABMP stands for algorithm due to Alt, Blum, Mehlhorn, and 
Paul~\cite{ABMP:matching}. 
The algorithm  has running time $O(\sqrt{n}m)$. The
algorithm consists of two major phases. In the first phase all 
augmenting paths of length less than |Lmax| are found, and in the 
second phase the remaining augmenting paths are determined. 
The default value of |Lmax| is $0.1 \sqrt{n}$. |Lmax| is an additional
optional parameter of the procedure. 

FF stands for the algorithm due to Ford and Fulkerson~\cite{Ford-Fulkerson}.
The algorithm has running time $O(nm)$ and FFB 
stands for a simple and slow version of FF. The algorithm FF has an additional
optional parameter |use_bfs| of type |bool|. If set to true, 
breadth-first-search is used in the search for augmenting paths, 
and if set to false, depth-first-search is used. 


Be aware that the algorithms \_XX change the graph $G$. They leave the 
graph structure unchanged but reorder adjacency lists (and hence change the
embedding). If this is undesirable you must restore the original order of the
adjacency lists as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
   edge_array<int> edge_number(G); int i = 0;
   forall_nodes(v,G) 
     forall_adj_edges(e,G) edge_number[e] = i++;
   call matching algorithm;
   G.sort_edges(edge_number);
\end{verbatim}
