We give functions
\begin{itemize}
\item to compute maximum-weight matchings,
\item to compute maximum-weight or minimum-weight perfect matchings, and
\item to check the optimality of weighted matchings
\end{itemize}
in general graph. 

You may skip the following subsections and restrict on
reading the function signatures and the corresponding comments in order to
use these functions. If you are interested in technical details, or if you
would like to ensure that the input data is well chosen, or if you would
like to know the exact meaning of all output parameters, you should continue
reading.

The functions in this section are template functions. It is intended that in 
the near future the template parameter |NT| can be instantiated with any number 
type. 
\textbf{Please note that for the time being the template functions 
are only guaranteed to perform correctly for the number type int.} 
In order to use the template version of the function the appropriate .h-file
must be included.
 
\verb+#include <LEDA/graph/templates/mw_matching.h>+ 

There are pre-instantiations for the number types |int|. 
In order to use them either

\verb+#include <LEDA/graph/mw_matching.h>+ 

or 

\verb+#include <LEDA/graph/graph_alg.h>+ 

has to be included (the latter file includes the former). 
The connection
between template functions and pre-instantiated functions is discussed in
detail in the section ``Templates for Network Algorithms'' of the LEDA book.
The function names of the pre-instantiated versions and the template versions
only differ by an additional suffix \verb+_T+ in the names of the latter ones. 

\paragraph{Proof of Optimality.}
Most of the functions for computing maximum or minimum weighted matchings provide a 
proof of optimality in the form of a dual solution represented by |pot|, 
|BT| and |b|. 
We briefly discuss their semantics:
Each node is associated with a potential which is stored in the node array |pot|.
The array |BT| (type |array<two_tuple<NT, int> >|) is used to represent the 
{\em nested family of odd cardinality sets} which is constructed during the 
course of the algorithm. 
For each (non-trivial) blossom ${B}$, a two tuple $(z_{B}, p_{B})$ is stored in |BT|,
where $z_B$ is the potential and $p_{B}$ is the {\em parent index} of $B$.
The parent index $p_{B}$ is set to $-1$ if ${B}$ is a surface blossom.
Otherwise, $p_{B}$ stores the index of the entry in |BT| corresponding to the 
immediate super-blossom of ${B}$.
The index range of |BT| is $[0,\dots,k-1]$, where $k$ denotes the number of 
(non-trivial) blossoms. Let $B'$ be a sub-blossom of $B$ and let the corresponding 
index of $B'$ and $B$ in |BT| be denoted by $i'$ and $i$, respectively. 
Then, $i' < i$.
In |b| (type |node_array<int>|) the parent index for each node $u$ is stored ($-1$ if
$u$ is not contained in any blossom).


\paragraph{Heuristics for Initial Matching Constructions.}
Each function can be asked to start with either an empty matching ($|heur|=0$), a greedy 
matching ($|heur| = 1$) or an (adapted) fractional matching ($|heur|=2$); by default, the 
fractional matching heuristic is used. 

\paragraph{Graph Structure.} 
All functions assume the underlying graph (type |graph|) to be connected, simple, loopfree 
and undirected (i.e., no anti-parallel edges).


\paragraph{Edge Weight Restrictions.}
The algorithms use divisions. In order to avoid rounding errors for the number type |int|, 
\textbf{please make sure that all edge weights are multiples of $4$; the algorithm will 
automatically multiply all edge weights by $4$ if this 
condition is not met.} (Then, however, the returned dual solution is valid only with respect 
to the modified weight function.)
Moreover, in the maximum-weight (non-perfect) matching case all edge weights are 
assumed to be non-negative.


\paragraph{Arithmetic Demand.} The arithmetic demand for integer edge weights is as follows.
Let $C$ denote the maximal absolute value of any edge weight and let $n$ be the number of 
nodes of the graph. \\
In the perfect weighted matching case we have 
for a potential |pot[u]| of a node $u$ 
and for a potential $z_B$ of a blossom $B$:
$$-nC/2 \;\le\; |pot[u]| \;\le\; (n+1)C/2 \quad\mathrm{and}\quad -nC \;\le\; z_B \;\le\; nC.$$

In the non-perfect matching case we have 
for a potential |pot[u]| of a node $u$ 
and for a potential $z_B$ of a blossom $B$:
$$0 \;\le\; |pot[u]| \;\le\; C \quad\mathrm{and}\quad 0 \;\le\; z_B \;\le\; C.$$

The function |CHECK_WEIGHTS| may be used to test whether the edge weights are feasible or not. It
is automatically called at the beginning of each of the algorithms
provided in this chapter.


\paragraph{Single Tree vs. Multiple Tree Approach:}
All functions can either run a {\em single tree approach} or a {\em multiple tree approach}. 
In the single tree approach, one alternating tree is grown from a free node at a time. 
In the multiple tree approach, multiple alternating trees are grown simultaneously from 
all free nodes. 
On large instances, the multiple tree approach is significantly faster and therefore is used by default.
If [[\#define _SST_APPROACH]] is defined {\em before} the template file is included all functions
will run the single tree approach.
%\\
%If additional information about the processing steps of the functions are desired the user may define 
%the [[_INFO]] token.


\paragraph{Worst-Case Running Time:}
All functions for computing maximum or minimum weighted (perfect or non-perfect) matchings guarantee 
a running time of $O(nm\log n)$, where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and edges, respectively.
