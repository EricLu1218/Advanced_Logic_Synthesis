GeoWin 3d convex hull demo\\
Use the mouse to input 3d points; all points
will get z-coordinate 0.
To change that click with the right mouse button
on an object, use object in the menu and change
the z-coordinate. Of course you can also generate
points with z-coordinate != 0 using Edit-Generate.

To show the three-dimensional output use
'Show d3 output' in the Window menu.
You can change some options of the 3-d output in the
Options- 3d output menu.
