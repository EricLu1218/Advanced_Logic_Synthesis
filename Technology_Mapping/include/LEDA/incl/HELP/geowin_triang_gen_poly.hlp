This demo program shows you the output of the triangulation algorithm
for generalized polygons. The output of the triangulation of a
generalized polygon is a planar embedded graph.
\\
The edges of the graph are partitioned into the following parts:
\\
- Outer triangulation (painted in grey color)
\\
- Inner triangulation (painted in blue color)
\\
- Boundaries (painted in red color)
\\
- Holes (painted in pink color)
\\
We show with arrows the direction of the boundary and hole edges.
